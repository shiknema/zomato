 # Introduction :-

This tutorial will walk through building a simple real-time restaurant app with React Native for Android and iOS. Along the way, you'll get to practice React Native basics and learn about tools you can use to build apps.

Work the tutorial at your own pace. The instructions below assume that you are comfortable with writing JavaScript and using cli.

## Notes for local Development :-
* npm install -g react-native-cli
* react-native init Your ProjectName
* cd projectname
* react-native run-android

## Installation :-
* npm install native-base --save
* react-native link
* react-native run-android

## Code  :

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';

AppRegistry.registerComponent('RnRestaurant', () => RnRestaurant);


## Props :-
- ImageBackground

- TouchableOpacity


# Summary
Building this small app, we've covered a lot of ground. We...
- Learned how to build project using native codes.
- Learned about the anatomy of a React Native module
- Learned about native primitives like Views, Texts, Images and more
- Learned how to style and layout our components with the CSS-like Flexbox implementation
- Learned how to gather user input with TextInput
- Learned how to work on the restaurant sidebar
- Learned about the power of third-party Components and how to use them in your app
- Learned how to split your app into multiple components

Of course, I didn't learn it very deeply. But now I have an idea on how to build a simple app in React Native, but the learning only starts here!
In this app there is only frontend work, There is no backend work in this app.I have named my app  RnRestaurant,which shows the restaurants.
